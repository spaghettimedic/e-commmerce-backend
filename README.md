## Installation
To install this application, go to the GitHub repository and download the zip file (or clone the code if you like), and run the following commands in your terminal at the root directory of the project: 'npm install', 'npm seed' (note: if you would like to seed the database yourself, you can skip the second command but there are seeds provided to get the application running quicker). You can then run 'npm start' from the terminal to open the port and start using a client of your choice to interact with the database (I used Insomnia, as shown in the screen shots).

## Usage
Create API calls in your client as shown below using the API routes. You can perform any CRUD operations you'd like for the models 'Category', 'Product', and 'Tag'.

[This walk-through video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/G0uQyqVHjAltLEXhgRp4) demonstrates how I created the database and its schema, as well as the API calls showing seeded data in Insomnia (READ routes only). [This continued walk-through video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/RK5n4Xwtr7ZLceZN0gZK) demonstrates more API calls in Insomnia being performed (CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE routes).
